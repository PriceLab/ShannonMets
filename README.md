The content is divided into two folders, one with the copies of notebooks used to generate main figures (as well as Supplementary Figure 2, which was originally a main figure) and one with code that can be run on the data to replicate our results. 

List of files in the FiguresNotebooks folder:
--------------------

LASSO_RIDGE_METABOLOMICS_ANALYSIS.ipynb - code used to generate analysis presented in figures 1 and 6 

FIGURE_2.ipynb -  code to generate Figure 2 

HEATMAPS_FIGURE3_SUPP_FIGURE2_SUPP_FIGURE6.ipynb -	Code to generate Figure 3, Supplementary figures 2 & 6 

Regression_analysis_Figure_4and5 - code used to generate analysis presented in figures 4 and 5

RF_Classification_Mets_and_Clinical_Labs.ipynb	- code used to generate analysis in figure 6 and supplementary figure 3

Clinical_Labs_Proteomics_Regression_Analysis - code used to generate analysis in figure 6C, performance of clinical labs and proteomics in predicting Shannon diversity in the discovery and validation cohorts

Validation_compositional_microbiome-3 (1).csv	microbiome -  composition median abundance data for validation cohort 

corr_df (1).csv -	correlation coefficients between metabolites and microbiome in discovery cohort 

corr_df_validation-2 (1).csv -	correlation coefficients between metabolites and microbiome in validation cohort 

corr_pval (1).csv	- p-values of correlation between metabolites and microbiome in discovery cohort

corr_pval_validation-2 (1).csv -	p-values of correlation between metabolites and microbiome in validation cohort 

discovery_medians.csv -	microbiome composition median abundance data for discovery cohort 

List of files in the ReplicationCode folder:
--------------------

Metabolomics_Shannon.ipynb - code used to predict Shannon diversity, as well as PD whole tree and Chao1, from plasma metabolomics. The code generates an R2 and extracts mean beta-coefficients from each of the ten cross-validations. RUN this code before proceeding to the Classification_Analysis or OLS_Regression, since these codes rely on .CSV files with the LASSSO identified metabolites. 

CL_P_Shannon.ipynb - code used to predict Shannon diversity from proteomics and Clinical labs across the discovery and validation cohorts. The code also calculates an R2 for different combinations of omics data.

Classification_Analysis.ipynb - code used to classify individuals in the bottom quartile of Shannon diversity using 11 plasma metabolites or a panel of clinical labs.

OLS_Regression.ipynb - code used to generate Ordinary Least Square Regression models between each metabolite and Shannon. The code depends on a list of the 40 mets identified, which is generated in using the "Metabolomics_Shannon" code. Same code can be used to generate OLS models with chemistries and proteomics.
